What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Initialising a repository tells git that you want it to run on this 
    directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is like a loading area for a commit. Files are added to the
    staging area then a commit is run to save the changes. File in the working 
    directory don't have to be put in the staging area, but if they aren't they
    won't be tracked by git.
