When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When working with others. To keep a backup online. When working on multiple PCs

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Allows you to keep control of what changes you bring down into your repository.
    Prevents introducing changes that you weren't expecting.
