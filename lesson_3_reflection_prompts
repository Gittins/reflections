When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When working with others. To keep a backup online. When working on multiple PCs

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Allows you to keep control of what changes you bring down into your repository.
    Prevents introducing changes that you weren't expecting.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

    Forks are a way of copying a repository only on GitHub.
    Clones are a way of copying a repository to your local machine from GitHub or another
    local area.
    Branches are a way of splitting out a repository, so changes can be made that don't 
    affect the original (master) repository either by yourself or when working with others.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It allows you to work on the latest version, up to that point, when not connected to 
    the internet.
